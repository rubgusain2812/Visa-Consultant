    <p>
        CZECH Visa Consultants Pvt Ltd is a professional Immigration & Quality Abroad Education
        Provider consultancy firm assisting clients with all aspects of immigration & Education
        Services to Canada and all the other countries since more than 11 years. Future
        Link has been providing quality Education and Immigration services to hundreds and
        thousands of our students and clients all over the country. Our mission is to provide
        creative, efficient and economical immigration & study solutions.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Mr.Santosh Ramrakhiani, Director of CZECH Consultants, is a member in good
        standing of the Visa Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (VCCRC) and
        therefore an Authorized Representative for conducting business with Citizenship
        and Immigration Canada on your behalf.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        "According to Canadian immigration law, ONLY a member of ICCRC or a member of a
        Canadian Law Society is allowed to represent you in Canadian immigration matters.
        If you use someone else, you risk having your application returned".</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        "VCCRC Members adhere to a strict code of ethics and professional standards. This
        is important because many firms claim expertise in Canadian immigration law and
        procedures but using an VCCRC member ensures that you are receiving advice from
        someone who has undergone a rigorous testing and who can genuinely give expert advice.
        It also ensures that you are protected by a Regulatory body and that your Immigration
        Consultant carries Errors and Omissions insurance etc.".</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Our approach is based on 3 fundamental principles to ensure you receive the highest
        possible quality of service:</p>
    <br />
    <h3>
        PERSONAL SERVICE:</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        We provide a highly personal service, tailored specifically to your individual needs.
        In an effort to improve productivity many immigration practitioners delegate the
        delivery of advice to junior staff or agents but inevitably this diminishes the
        quality of advice you receive and could lead to critical errors or omissions. When
        you retain Future Link Visa Consultants Pvt Ltd your case is managed directly by
        Mr.Santosh Ramrakhiani (Director), who is an VCCRC member..</p>
    <br />
    <h3>
        FLEXIBILITY:</h3>
    <p>
        We would advice up-front about which stream/category to apply under. Also would
        prepare your entire application and represent your case at Canadian High Commission
        on your behalf.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>
        PLAN AHEAD:</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
        Sometimes there doesn't seem to be an obvious route into Canada or you don't quite
        seem to qualify for any of the usual streams. Or sometimes there does seem to be
        an obvious route but, taking a longer-term view it might not be the best one for
        you. We pride ourselves in planning ahead and looking beyond the obvious. For example
        you may have an employer that wants to bring you to Canada on a temporary work permit,
        but you run the risk of having to leave Canada if the job doesn't work out because
        your work permit is linked to a specific employer. We may be able to identify a
        route that would gain you permanent residency instead or an "open" work permit so
        that you have full employment mobility.</p>
